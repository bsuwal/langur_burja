### Next steps
* Need to rename the "payoff" function and call it "house return" or something like that. Then write an actual payoff function where positive value represents profit.
* What is the effect on expected payoff of putting बोट on multiple symbols? I have written a function
for the case of 2 and 3 bots, but I need to write a general function.

### Questions to explore
* ~~What is the probability of seeing at least 1 जुट in a round? How does this change when the number of dice $N$ changes?~~
* Varying $F$ with $N$ constant - what is the exact relationship of $N$ and $F$?
* How can you model the folklore lesson that playing small बोट is better than large ones?
